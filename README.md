## LEARNING FISHING INFORMATION FROM AIS DATA

Repository containing the code used in the Use Case from the paper **On the use of trajectory data for tackling data scarcity**, with the instructions of how to run it.The repository is structured in three folders:
- *AIS*: contains the code used to clean and preprocess the trajectory AIS data according to the heuristic rules.
- *enviromental*: contains the code used to extract, reescale, clean and preprocess the enviromental data from different sources.
